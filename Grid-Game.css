/* Using any of the tools you've worked with so far, create a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
Create a Tic-Tac-Toe game grid using your HTML element of choice.
When a cell in the grid is clicked, an X or O should appear in that spot depending on whose turn it is.
A heading should say whether it is X's or O's turn and change with each move made.
A button should be available to clear the grid and restart the game.
When a player has won, or the board is full and the game results in a draw, a Bootstrap alert or 
similar Bootstrap component should appear across the screen announcing the winner */
